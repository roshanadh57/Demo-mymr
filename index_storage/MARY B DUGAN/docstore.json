S Farrukh MD \nLocation of Care: Antelope Valley Neuroscience Medi cal Group \nHistory of Present Illness: \nSo I saw Mary today she continued to have pain in t he back around the right hip goes to the groin \ninteresting the pain comes like she bends her knees  or she is in bed and she tried to roll the pain in  the \ngroin, about the portals and her and her knee she h ad a facet injection that helpful for 5 days inject ion only \nhelped the back but not the hip and physical therap y made things worse \nMRI of the spine showed evidence of abnormal disc a t L5-S1 with a 7-8 mm disc protrusion and extrusion  \nwhich extend below the disc space to 7 mm there is a disc bulge worse in comparison to the prior exam \ndated 10/14/2015 there is mild ligamentum flavum an d facet hypertrophy and there is severe lateral \nrecess stenosis and neuroforaminal narrowing bilate rally at L5-S1 and it says worse on the left than t he \nright side with the patient symptoms are more right -sided and is mostly in the groin \nSo the patient says sometimes she has pain down the  leg but the consistent pain is in the groin area \nupper area is I spent time with the patient she has  early pain in the L3-L4 distribution occasionally in the \ncalf \nAt L3-4 there is 2-3 mm left paracentral disc bulge  that is mild to moderate ligamentum flavum and fac et \nhypertrophy there is mild lateral recess and neurof oraminal narrowing there is no significant central spinal \ncanal stenosis at L2-L3 there is moderate to severe  space narrowing there is a 45 mm disc bulge there is \na mild ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy ther e is moderate lateral recess stenosis and \nneuroforaminal narrowing greater on the right than the left with impingement of the exiting traversing  nerve \nroots \nSo for now in order an EMG of L1-L2-L3 L4-L5-S1 on the right side also like to obtain a perform a \ntransforaminal injection of the L1 nerve root to se e if the pain in in the groin goes away in the mean time I \nexamined the patient and interesting internal or ex ternal rotation of the hip did not produce any pain  in the \ngroin sitting straight leg raising did not produce pain Straight leg raising pain with both leg down p atient \nsays the pain in the back is worse and she gets up and she moves around introversive junk she gets \nbetter she medicates herself with Tylenol\nThe MRI of the right hip show mild to moderate join t space narrowing and degenerative changes of the \nright hip there is preservation of the medial aspec t of the labrum on the right hip there is moderate \ntendinosis of the obturate this externus muscles bi laterally greater on the right and the left there i s also \nmild tendinosis of the gluteus medius and gluteus m inimus muscles bilaterally greater on the right tha n the \nleft there is mild tendinosis of the hamstring bila teral patient has also mild increased signal in the  \nglutenous maximus muscle on the right consistent wi th partial tear \nWe 3 issues we have hip problem pathology rehab the  muscles of the hip the glutes with tendinosis as \nwell as the hamstrings and obturator muscles the st ent and the patient has an orthopedic surgeon 3 \nI will deal with the radiculopathy pleats \nCurrent Allergies: \nNo known allergies \nRadiology Impression \nReview of Records \nAntelope Valley Neuroscience Medical Group June  9, 2025 \n42135 10th
