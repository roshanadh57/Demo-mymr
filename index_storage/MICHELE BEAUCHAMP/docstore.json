I had recommended her to consider Watchman device procedure.\nI explained to her the risks, benefits, and alternatives including a small risk of bleeding, stroke, vascular injury,\nartery injury to the heart etc. and the need for taking antiplatelet agent for 45 days after and she is willing to\nproceed now. she has transport issues to and from the hospital and therefore had declined the procedure but now\nshe wants to proceed.\nINSERTION, WATCHMAN LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE CLOSURE DEVICE (33340) ; Routine ()\nContinued aspirin 81 mg tablet,delayed release, 1 (one) tablet daily, #90, 90 days starting 05/19/2025, Ref.\nx3.\nFollow up in 6 months or as needed\nDyslipidemia\nProblem Story: She has been intolerant to statin therapy.\nToday's Impression: LDL was 141 on 5/5/23.
