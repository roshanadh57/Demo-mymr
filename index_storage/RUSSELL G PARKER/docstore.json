He had recurrent A-fib with RVR and heart failure exacerbation with reduction in his LV function\nin February 2025 when he was admitted to AV MC.\nToday's Impression: He was cardioverted back to sinus rhythm in February 2025. His EKG shows sinus rhythm\nwith underlying left bundle branch block currently. I have asked him to stay on Pacerone and Eliquis. Since he has\nhad peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding in the past and is high risk of recurrent bleeding on anticoagulation I have\noffered him left atrial appendage closure with a Watchman device. I have described to him the procedure, risks,\nbenefits, and alternatives including a small risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, injury to the blood vessels, lung, or\nthe heart etc. and he is willing to proceed.\nINSERTION, WATCHMAN LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE CLOSURE DEVICE (33340) ; Routine ()\nContinued Eliquis 5 mg tablet, 1 (one) tablet BID, #180, 90 days starting 05/21/2025, Ref. x3.\nContinued Pacerone 200 mg tablet, 1 (one) tablet two times daily, #180, 90 days starting 05/21/2025, Ref.\nx3.\nFollow up in 3 months or as needed\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction\nProblem Story: Echocardiogram done on 6/12/23 incidentally showed LVEF of 10-15% with a dilated\ncardiomyopathy. BNP 980 7/27/23. He likely had tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy and he was cardioverted into\nsinus rhythm in May 2023 from atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram on 10/20/2023 when he was hospitalized at AV MC\nshowed LVEF of 50 to 55%.
