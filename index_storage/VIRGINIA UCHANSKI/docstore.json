Uchanski  (DOB  07/30/1943) Date of Encounter:    06/17/2025\n \n \nHistory of Present Illness    \nThe patient is a 81 year old female who is here for a follow up visit.hospital follow up\nAdditional reasons for visit:\nAortic stenosis  is described as the following:\n6\nVirginia is doing reasonably well in general, apart from the usual aches pains as well as general signs of aging.  She was\ntroubled with dyspnea on exertion as well as pedal edema last year. Additionally, she had at least 2 episodes of severe\nlightheadedness verging on syncope.  The echocardiogram in April 2021 revealed normal left ventricular function as well as\nnormal bioprosthetic aortic valve function with at least moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation not previously documented on\nthe echocardiogram done and it Cedars Sinai.  I subsequently performed a transesophageal echocardiogram on 11/18/2021.\n  The mitral regurgitation did not appear as severe as it was noted on the transthoracic echo, only in the mild to moderate\nrange.  The TAVR, nearly 6 years old, is beginning to show signs of degeneration.  The latest transaortic gradient of March\n2024 was around 40 mmHg The left ventricular function was also normal.  There is also moderate mitral regurgitation,\ncentral. A more recent echocardiogram of April 2025 revealed what appears to be moderate to severe bioprosthetic aortic\nstenosis As well as moderate Central mitral regurgitation..\nShe was in the emergency room at PRMC with leg swelling and pain.  She was given Lasix and things have improved.  The\nswelling continues to come and go.  Her PCP started her on a diuretic but after discussion we opted to use that sparingly\nbecause of the concern about renal dysfunction.  \nShe has recently tripped, fallen and sustained a rather extensive bruise on her right leg which has resolved.  On a recent\noccasion she had a near syncopal episode while at Costco shopping.  On another occasion while in the car she had some\nvisual changes were everything became bright for a few seconds.\nI obtained a 14-day monitor on October 2024.  This visit revealed paroxysmal A-fib with an episode that lasted more than 5\nhours. She was switched to dabigatran and Plavix was discontinued. Recently returned related revealed a suspicion of\nmyelodysplasia and she is now awaiting bone marrow biopsy.\nTransition into care  is described as the following:\nNote for \"Transition into care\": To continue cardiac care.\nAllergies\nPenicillin G Pot in Dextrose *PENICILLINS* [Drug allergy]\nAccolate *ANTIASTHMATIC AND BRONCHODILATOR AGENTS* [Drug allergy]\nTopamax *ANTICONVULSANTS* [Drug allergy]\nBextra *ANALGESICS - ANTI-INFLAMMATORY* [Drug allergy]\n \n Tuesday, July 1, 2025   Page 1 / 7  \nPast Medical History\nHeart murmur\nSquamous cell carcinoma, face\nCarotid atherosclerosis\nAortic stenosis ; Severe, with a valve area of approximately 0.8 cm\u00b2, based on the echocardiogram done February\n2015.

I have arranged for her to have right and left cardiac catheterization in\npreparation for possible valve in valve TAVR.\nThe steps, risks, benefits and alternatives of cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography and percutaneous\ncoronary interventions were explained in detail to the patient. Percutaneous Coronary interventions entail the use of\na variety of tools/devices including guide wires, balloons, stents as well as atherectomy and reentry devices. A\ntemporary pacemaker as well as left ventricular assist devices may be necessary. The risks include, but not limited\nto, myocardial infarction, contrast reactions, vascular access complications, stroke, tamponade, renal failure and\ndeath. The patient understood and has accepted.\nSchedule - Left and Right Heart Cath\nFuture Procedures:\n04/30/2025:  ECHOCARDIOGRAM (93306); Routine one time ()\nMitral regurgitation\nToday's Impression: There was documentation of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation in late 2021. She was\nalso troubled with dyspnea on minimal exertion as well as pedal edema. She has also had a few presyncopal\nepisodes. I wondered if the mitral regurgitation is severe enough to warrant intervention such as with a MitraClip.\nI obtained a transesophageal echocardiogram on 11/18/2021. The mitral regurgitation did not appear as severe as\nit was noted on the transthoracic echo, in the mild to moderate range. We even used phenylephrine to increase the\nvascular resistance and see if that would worsen the mitral regurgitation, and does not. The TAVR, nearly 5 years\nold, seemed to be functioning normally. She continues to have dyspnea on moderate exertion, at the time not as\nbad as previously.\nAll that is needed at this time is observation. The shortness of breath is likely related to aging and deconditioning,\nalso likely impaired left ventricular diastolic properties.\nThe latest echocardiogram of March 2024 revealed moderate central mitral regurgitation. A more conservative\napproach is warranted at this time. This was essentially unchanged on the echo of April 2025.\nLeg swelling\nToday's Impression: This has been quite troublesome of late and usually follows long days at Disneyland. She\nhas a past as her husband used to work for Disney. He goes there frequently. I am sure there is a degree of dietary\nindiscretion with excess salt. She was recently emergency room with an episode of edema. She is currently on Lasix\nbut I advised her not to use it more than 1 week. She is likely retaining salt and water intermittently.\nNear syncope\nToday's Impression: I suspected she may be developing intermittent A-V block or sick sinus syndrome. The\nformer is not terribly unlikely as she had a TAVR a few years ago. I obtained a 14 day monitor in August of last year\nwhich revealed no significant bradycardia or arrhythmias. Her symptoms have recurred with an recent near single\nepisode while shopping at Costco as well as an episode where she suddenly saw a bright light and nothing else for a\nfew seconds.

She was\ntroubled with dyspnea on exertion as well as pedal edema last year. Additionally, she had at least 2 episodes of severe\nlightheadedness verging on syncope.  The echocardiogram in April 2021 revealed normal left ventricular function as well as\nnormal bioprosthetic aortic valve function with at least moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation not previously documented on\nthe echocardiogram done and it Cedars Sinai.  I subsequently performed a transesophageal echocardiogram on 11/18/2021.\n  The mitral regurgitation did not appear as severe as it was noted on the transthoracic echo, only in the mild to moderate\nrange.  The TAVR, nearly 6 years old, is beginning to show signs of degeneration.  The latest transaortic gradient of March\n2024 was around 40 mmHg The left ventricular function was also normal.  There is also moderate mitral regurgitation,\ncentral. A more recent echocardiogram of April 2025 revealed what appears to be moderate to severe bioprosthetic aortic\nstenosis As well as moderate Central mitral regurgitation..\nShe was in the emergency room at PRMC with leg swelling and pain.  She was given Lasix and things have improved.  The\nswelling continues to come and go.  Her PCP started her on a diuretic but after discussion we opted to use that sparingly\nbecause of the concern about renal dysfunction.  \nShe has recently tripped, fallen and sustained a rather extensive bruise on her right leg which has resolved.  On a recent\noccasion she had a near syncopal episode while at Costco shopping.  On another occasion while in the car she had some\nvisual changes were everything became bright for a few seconds.\nI obtained a 14-day monitor on October 2024.  This visit revealed paroxysmal A-fib with an episode that lasted more than 5\nhours. She was switched to dabigatran and Plavix was discontinued. Recently returned related revealed a suspicion of\nmyelodysplasia and she is now awaiting bone marrow biopsy.\nTransition into care  is described as the following:\nNote for \"Transition into care\": To continue cardiac care.\nAllergies\nPenicillin G Pot in Dextrose *PENICILLINS* [Drug allergy]\nAccolate *ANTIASTHMATIC AND BRONCHODILATOR AGENTS* [Drug allergy]\nTopamax *ANTICONVULSANTS* [Drug allergy]\nBextra *ANALGESICS - ANTI-INFLAMMATORY* [Drug allergy]\n \n Tuesday, July 1, 2025   Page 1 / 7  \nMedication History\nPradaxa (150mg capsule 1 Capsule oral 2 times per day, Taken starting 04/08/2025) Active - Hx Entry.\namiodarone (100mg tablet 1 (one) tablet oral daily, Taken starting 02/18/2025) Active - Hx Entry.\nEliquis (2.5mg tablet 1 oral two times daily, Taken starting 02/18/2025) Active - Hx Entry.\nEliquis (5mg tablet, 1 Tablet oral 2 times per day, Taken starting 11/06/2024) Active.\nXanax (0.25MG tablet, prn Oral) Inactive.\nWellbutrin XL (300MG Tablet, Extende, 1/2 Oral qd) Active.\nVitamin D ( Oral) Specific strength unknown - Active.\nMultivitamins (1 tab Oral qd) Active.\nB12 Fast Dissolve (1 Oral daily) Specific strength unknown - Active.\nClopidogrel Bisulfate (75MG tablet, 1 (one) Oral daily) Active.\nCrestor (5MG tablet, 1 tab Oral daily) Active.\nAlbuterol Sulfate HFA (108 (90 Base)MCG/ACT HFA Aerosol Inh, 1 puff Inhalation as needed) Active.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3683, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "548d0137-3b5f-40eb-b746-f82986aa8067": {"__data__": {"id_": "548d0137-3b5f-40eb-b746-f82986aa8067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data/VIRGINIA UCHANSKI/Progress Note_2025-07-01_1_5_7.pdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7327cb0d162510b3ff69bf69775ca27860029d6b28ae0678d79a9c5eae151ca1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be550b3e-85d4-4663-81d6-3ecb754cd351", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31c3e3620bd6dcc303447b0f9d25c727cdade828f98ad0cb485981dc6346dee1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82471e62-d37e-49f2-947d-ace362ef3863", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12ada138a2dca70a297d00f027b95abb99d5eaec7888952ecc4917cc26079142", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Eliquis (5mg tablet, 1 Tablet oral 2 times per day, Taken starting 11/06/2024) Active.\nXanax (0.25MG tablet, prn Oral) Inactive.\nWellbutrin XL (300MG Tablet, Extende, 1/2 Oral qd) Active.\nVitamin D ( Oral) Specific strength unknown - Active.\nMultivitamins (1 tab Oral qd) Active.\nB12 Fast Dissolve (1 Oral daily) Specific strength unknown - Active.\nClopidogrel Bisulfate (75MG tablet, 1 (one) Oral daily) Active.\nCrestor (5MG tablet, 1 tab Oral daily) Active.\nAlbuterol Sulfate HFA (108 (90 Base)MCG/ACT HFA Aerosol Inh, 1 puff Inhalation as needed) Active.\nALPRAZolam (0.25MG tablet, 1 Oral as needed) Active.\nolmesartan (40mg tablet, 1 oral daily) Active.\nCaltrate with Vitamin D3 (600 mg-20 mcg(800 unit) tablet, 1 oral daily) Active.\nBenicar (40mg tablet, 1 oral daily) Active.\n \nOther Problems\nUnspecified Diagnosis\n \nPast Surgical\nCholecystectomy\nTubal Ligation\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma Excision ; Right lower side of face\n \nReview of Systems   \nGeneral  Not Present- Appetite Loss and Fatigue.\nSkin Not Present- Bruising, Itching and Rash.\nHEENT  Not Present- Blurred Vision, Dentures, Headache, Hearing Loss, Loose teeth, Nasal polyps, Nose Bleed, Permanent\nblindness in either eye, Sore Throat, Vertigo and Wears glasses/contact lenses.\nNeck  Not Present- Neck Pain and Neck Stiffness.\nRespiratory  Not Present- Bloody sputum, Cough, Decreased Exercise Tolerance, Difficulty Breathing, Hemoptysis, Recent\nbronchitis or chest cold, Sputum Production and Wheezing.\nCardiovascular  Present- Swelling of Extremities.

The latest echocardiogram was done\non 11/11/2019 and revealed normal left ventricular function and normal bioprosthetic aortic valve hemodynamics.\nShe also had moderate mitral annular calcification with mild regurgitation.\n Tuesday, July 1, 2025   Page 5 / 7  \nThe latest echocardiogram of March 2024 revealed 40 mm gradient across the aortic valve bioprosthesis. This seems\nto have worsened based on the echocardiogram of April 2025. It has been now 9 years since the TAVR and I\nsuspect there is significant degeneration. I have arranged for her to have right and left cardiac catheterization in\npreparation for possible valve in valve TAVR.\nThe steps, risks, benefits and alternatives of cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography and percutaneous\ncoronary interventions were explained in detail to the patient. Percutaneous Coronary interventions entail the use of\na variety of tools/devices including guide wires, balloons, stents as well as atherectomy and reentry devices. A\ntemporary pacemaker as well as left ventricular assist devices may be necessary. The risks include, but not limited\nto, myocardial infarction, contrast reactions, vascular access complications, stroke, tamponade, renal failure and\ndeath. The patient understood and has accepted.\nSchedule - Left and Right Heart Cath\nFuture Procedures:\n04/30/2025:  ECHOCARDIOGRAM (93306); Routine one time ()\nMitral regurgitation\nToday's Impression: There was documentation of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation in late 2021. She was\nalso troubled with dyspnea on minimal exertion as well as pedal edema. She has also had a few presyncopal\nepisodes. I wondered if the mitral regurgitation is severe enough to warrant intervention such as with a MitraClip.\nI obtained a transesophageal echocardiogram on 11/18/2021. The mitral regurgitation did not appear as severe as\nit was noted on the transthoracic echo, in the mild to moderate range. We even used phenylephrine to increase the\nvascular resistance and see if that would worsen the mitral regurgitation, and does not. The TAVR, nearly 5 years\nold, seemed to be functioning normally. She continues to have dyspnea on moderate exertion, at the time not as\nbad as previously.\nAll that is needed at this time is observation. The shortness of breath is likely related to aging and deconditioning,\nalso likely impaired left ventricular diastolic properties.\nThe latest echocardiogram of March 2024 revealed moderate central mitral regurgitation. A more conservative\napproach is warranted at this time. This was essentially unchanged on the echo of April 2025.\nLeg swelling\nToday's Impression: This has been quite troublesome of late and usually follows long days at Disneyland. She\nhas a past as her husband used to work for Disney. He goes there frequently. I am sure there is a degree of dietary\nindiscretion with excess salt. She was recently emergency room with an episode of edema. She is currently on Lasix\nbut I advised her not to use it more than 1 week.
